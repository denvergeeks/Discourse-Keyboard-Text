This forked version adds the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl-K</kbd> to insert the code.

# Discourse-Keyboard-Text
A super simple component which allows quick &lt;kbd> usage
# Bugs?
I tested this using discourse's core themes and doesn't seem to have a problem. If there is functionality problems, it's probably an issue with your discourse or any unsupported themes. 

```<kbd>``` is fun!
